.Net Framework recommends that the TLS version should not be hardcoded and applications should use the TLS version the operating system (OS) supports, to ensure .NET Framework applications remain secure
But we still could setup tls versions we want to use in appsettings.json, for example:
```
"Kestrel": {
    "EndpointDefaults": {
      "SslProtocols": [
        "Tls12",
        "Tls13"
      ]
    }
  },
```
By default it use 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3

If we use only TLS 1.1, we get warning and even after allowing, we got the site can't be reached page

With TLS 1.2 everything works fine, because it's current standard. TLS 1.2 was default one that was used by my client. Here we can also see which cipher suit is used

And for TLS 1.3, was getting error, probably because not supported properly yet
```
Unhandled exception while processing 0HMEOFLHGHDEF.
System.ComponentModel.Win32Exception (0x80090331): The client and server cannot communicate, because they do not possess a common algorithm.
```
Even after enabling in windows settings, got nothing

On the second picture you can see that we already have valid certificate, it was automatically made by framework. But we made another one for localhost using mkcert.
