We used Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity framework. It already has default pages for registration and log in. Field that validates passwords and show errors also is in the project by default, and located in
Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/Register.cshtml.cs Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/ResetPassword.cshtml.cs We can password validation logic by using services.Configure<IdentityOptions>, but by default, identity requires that passwords contain an uppercase character, lowercase character, a digit, and a non-alphanumeric character. Also passwords must be at least six characters long. 
This framework has features like AccessFailedCount, LockoutEnabled and LockoutEnd, so other person can't try to guess password by inputting many times in a row. Also it has email confirmation logic which we ca implement later

For password hashing ASP.NET uses uses a Key Derivation Function with random salt to produce the hash. The cool thing, which in first I didn't get, is that salt is included as part of the output of the KDF. Thus, our database doesn't have field with salt, so each time we hash the same password we will get different results. For this lab we decided to use argon2 by Konscious.Security.Cryptography with this configuration:
```
Argon2DegreeOfParallelism = 8;
Argon2Iterations = 4;
Argon2MemorySize = 1024 * 1024
```
To verify the hash, we split the output back to the salt and the rest, and the argon2 is run again on the password with the specified salt. If the result matches to the rest of the initial output the hash is verified. All we need to use our hasher over default one is changed realization for IPasswordHasher in Startup.cs
For db we used Microsoft SQL Servers. AspNetUsers table:

This framework's default user identity lacks password version number. Thus, if we will want to change password hashing, we could do it easily. And also it lacks `isHacked` bool field in case of leaked database, so we can ask user to change password next time if tries to login.
