To implement storage we added own implementation `UserOnlyStore<IdentityUser>`, which overrides default functions, that was returning plain text.
Keys logic was setup in builder. Here you can choose directory, where keys will be stored, set key lifetime, and choose cryptographic algorithms.

```
builder.Services.AddDataProtection()
    .PersistKeysToFileSystem(new DirectoryInfo(keysFolder))
    .SetApplicationName("CryptoBlazorApp")
    .SetDefaultKeyLifetime(TimeSpan.FromDays(90))
    .UseCryptographicAlgorithms(new AuthenticatedEncryptorConfiguration
    {EncryptionAlgorithm = EncryptionAlgorithm.AES_256_GCM});
```

We chose AES256-GCM for encrypting for few reasons. It was already included in Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.AuthenticatedEncryption, AES256-GCM is secure and already come with MAC, which is very comfortable for usage. Also framework automatically monitor the life cycle of the keys and update them, but it don't update your database, you should do it yourself 

Most possible vector for attack on our system is probably to stole keys, because we store them just in root folder of server, which is not very secure
